I'm Co-Founder of [Phoenix Squadron](https://phoenixsquadron.concordiashanghai.org/), and President of PFL ( Phoenix Flight Laboratory). I've worked extensively with the DJI Tello SDK & Drone during my earlier years of High-School. I'm currently focusing on ROS based PixHawk programming. Please checkout some of me repositories, and my organization: [Github Link(https://github.com/PhoenixSquadron). On the ground, I'm working on developing various anti-collision systems, ADAS, and level 3 autonomous driving algorithms.
